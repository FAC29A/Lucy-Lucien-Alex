<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Command Processing**: As a back-end developer, I want to process commands directed at my bot by using string matching or a command prefix to distinguish between general messages and commands meant for the bot.

1. **Command Prefix Setting**: As a developer, I want to set a command prefix for my bot, so it can recognise when a message is a command. For instance, using "!" before a command (like **`!help`**).
2. **Help Command**: As a developer, I want to implement a **`help`** command, so that when a user types **`!help`**, the bot will send a message listing all available commands and their descriptions.
3. **Greetings Command**: As a developer, I want to create a **`greet`** command, so that when a user types **`!greet`**, the bot will respond with a personalised greeting message, like "Hello, [username]!"
4. **Random Joke Command**: As a developer, I want to add a **`joke`** command, so that when a user types **`!joke`**, the bot will respond with a random joke.
5. **Echo Command**: As a developer, I want to implement an **`echo`** command, so that when a user types **`!echo [message]`**, the bot will repeat the message back to them.

1. **Weather Information Command**: As a developer, I want to implement a **`weather`** command, so users can type **`!weather [city name]`** to get the current weather information for a specified city. This will involve integrating an external weather API.
2. **Poll Creation Command**: As a developer, I want to create a **`poll`** command, so that users can create interactive polls in the chat by typing **`!poll [question] [option1] [option2] ...`**. The bot should be able to tally votes and display results.
3. **Music Play Command**: As a developer, I want to implement a **`play`** command for music, so that users can play music in a voice channel by typing **`!play [song name or URL]`**. This requires handling audio streams and interfacing with Discord's voice channels.

- **Error Handling**: As a beginner, I want to implement error handling in my bot interactions using **`try...catch`** within my **`async`** functions to manage exceptions and provide error messages if something goes wrong.
